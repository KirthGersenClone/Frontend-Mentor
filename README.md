## My first experience with Frontend Mentor and Github

I am still figuring out how to publish my first solution to the Frontend Mentor site.

## QR-code-component

I have recently followed online courses in Belgium via the VDAB-Website. Their courses are good but dated.
There is no mention on Flex nor Grid, but I learned how to float, so I wont drown.

So this first assignment, project, excercise (whatever you want to call it) posed a challenge on how to
center an element. I experimented with flex (with the aid of W3Schools and the MDN-website).
I also learned more on Google Fonts, and how to import them.
